    "## Tutorial Description\n",
    "In the previous tutorials, you created agents, queried them with AgentSet, and learned\n",
    "activation patterns. In this tutorial, we cover **time** — how Mesa models progress\n",
    "through time, how you run simulations, and how to schedule events that happen at specific\n",
    "moments.\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial you will know how to:\n",
    "- Understand the two time-tracking attributes: `model.steps` and `model.time`\n",
    "- Run models with `run_for()` and `run_until()`\n",
    "- Schedule one-off events at absolute or relative times\n",
    "- Schedule recurring events with `Schedule`\n",
    "- Control event priority\n",
    "- Cancel events and stop recurring generators\n",
    "- Combine step-based agent activation with discrete events in a single model"

    "## How Time Works in Mesa\n",
    "Every Mesa model tracks two time-related attributes:\n",
    "- **`model.time`** — A float representing the current simulation time (starts at 0.0).\n",
    "### The default step mechanism\n",
    "When you define a `step()` method on your model and advance time, Mesa wraps your step\n",
    "in an internal event system. Each step:\n",
    "1. Advances `model.time` by 1.0\n",
    "2. Executes your `step()` method\n",
    "You never call `model.step()` directly to run a simulation. Instead, use:\n",
    "- **`model.run_for(n)`** — Advance time by `n` units (executing `n` steps for standard models)\n",
    "- **`model.run_until(t)`** — Advance time until `model.time` reaches `t`\n",
    "These methods are the primary way to run any Mesa model."
