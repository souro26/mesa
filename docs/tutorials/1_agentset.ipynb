    "This tutorial builds on the Boltzmann Wealth Model from the [First Model tutorial](0_first_model.ipynb).\n",
    "In the first tutorial you created agents, put them in a model, and had them exchange money.\n",
    "Now we'll explore **AgentSet** — Mesa's core tool for querying, filtering, grouping, and\n",
    "inspecting collections of agents.\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you will know how to:\n",
    "- Retrieve attribute values from agents\n",
    "- Filter agents with `select`\n",
    "- Compute aggregate statistics with `agg`\n",
    "- Group agents by attributes with `groupby`\n",
    "- Combine these tools to answer questions about your model's state\n",
    "The *next* tutorial covers how to use AgentSet for **activating** agents (calling their\n",
    "methods). We separate these concerns because querying agents and activating agents are\n",
    "conceptually different — you'll often query first and activate a subset."
